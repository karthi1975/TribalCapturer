## Writing Tips

✅ **DO**:
- Write like teaching a new MA
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Use numbers for steps: (1), (2), (3)
- Include timing: "within 48 hours", "2-4 weeks later"
- Mention consequences: "or appointment will be rescheduled"

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use abbreviations without explaining
- Assume knowledge - be explicit
- Skip the "why" - AI learns from it
- Write one-word entries - add context!

## Examples by Length

**Too Short** (❌):
```
Patient needs labs
```

**Better** (✅):
```
Heart failure patients need BNP labs within 48 hours before appointment.
```

**Best** (🌟):
```
Heart failure follow-up appointments require: (1) BNP labs drawn within
48 hours before appointment, (2) Current weight, (3) BP log from home
monitoring. If morning appointment, patient should be NPO after midnight.
Dr. Mitchell will not see patient without recent BNP levels.
```
